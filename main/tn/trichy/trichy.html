            <p>Coimbatore is a city in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. 
                To the northwest is the centuries-old, Dravidian-style Arulmigu 
                Subramaniyaswami Temple, Marudamalai. The colorful and intricately 
                carved Arulmigu Patteeswarar Swamy Temple lies southeast of here. 
                In the center, the Gass Forest Museum has a huge collection of preserved 
                animals and tree trunks. Southeast, birds and butterflies inhabit Singanallur Lake.
