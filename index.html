<p><center>South India is the area encompassing the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana as well as the union territories of Andaman and Nicobar, Lakshadweep and Puducherry, occupying 19.31% of India's area (635,780 km2 or 245,480 sq mi).<br><br> Covering the southern part of the peninsular Deccan Plateau, South India is bounded by the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Arabian Sea in the west and the Indian Ocean in the south. <br><br>The geography of the region is diverse with two mountain ranges - the Western and Eastern Ghats, bordering the plateau heartland. Godavari, Krishna, Kaveri, Tungabhadra and Vaigai rivers are important non-perennial sources of water.<br><br>

    The majority of the people in South India speak one of the four major Dravidian languages: Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam. Some states/UTs also recognise minority language as Urdu in Telangana, French in Puducherry, and Bengali in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.<br><br> Besides these languages, English is used by both central and state Governments for communication purpose and can be found in all public sign boards.<br><br>
    
    During its history, a number of dynastic kingdoms ruled over parts of South India and the Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent across southern and southeastern Asia impacted the history and culture in those regions.<br><br> Major dynasties that were established in South India include the Cheras, Cholas, Pandyas, Pallavas, Satavahanas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Madurai, Bahmani, Deccan Sultanates, Vijayanagara, Maratha Empire and Mysore. European powers entered India through Kerala.<br><br> South India witnessed sustained growth in per capita income and population, structural change in the economy, and increased pace of technological innovation, and reached the height of its economic and military power and dominion in the latter half of the 18th century under the de facto ruler Haider Ali and his son Tipu Sultan.<br><br> South India was under the rule of Portuguese India and British Raj. The Hyderabad State ruled by the Nizams was the last princely state of India.
    
    After experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after Indian independence, the economies of South Indian states have registered higher than national average growth over the past three decades. While South Indian states have improved in some socio-economic metrics, poverty continues to affect the region much like the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. <br><br>HDI in the southern states is high and the economy has undergone growth at a faster rate than most northern states. Literacy rates in the southern states are higher than the national average with approximately 81% of the population capable of reading and writing. This is much higher than the northern states in India. The fertility rate in South India is 1.9, the lowest of all regions in India.</center> </p>
